The website showcases every conference, team, and player in NCAA College Football Divison I FBS in the 2014 season, including stats, schedules, and player information. The database contains over 14,000 entries.

                         I was primarily responsible for the layout, design, and graphical user interface/front-end portions of the website. I initialized the GUI using a premade Bootstrap theme, but soon veered far from the original template code. I created the GUI template based on my original conceptual layout and design of the website, and with the help from other team mates, I populated the pages with the appropriate data. I worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap during this projects.

                            <strong>Description:</strong> My partner and I developed an algorithm for the Netflix Prize coding competition held in 2009. The prize would award $1 Million to the group who could develop an algorithm to predict user movie ratings at least 10% better than the one they already had. We wrote our algorithm in 2015, so obviously the compeition had since ended. We were only given 3 types of data points: a list of every user's previous movie ratings, a list of all ratings for each movie, and the movie release date of each movie. The actual competitors were allowed to integrate essentially endless amounts of data into their algorithms, but despite our relatively specific data set, we still managed to develop an algorithm that could predict user movie ratings 2% better than Netflix had done prior to the competition. Netflix's RMSE value from their algorithm was 0.95, where ours was 0.93. Although it is not remarkably better, I believe there is still some merit to the fact that we beat Netflix, no matter by how much or little.

The shell handles a number of builtin commands, including quit, fg (moves job specified by process ID to the foreground), bg (moves job specified by process ID to the background), and jobs (prints list of all current jobs). The shell also can perform any executable programs specified by a path, and has signal handlers that catch "ctrl ^C" and "ctrl ^Z" commands.

                            <strong>Description:</strong> This program recreates the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) commercial block cipher algorithm, designed to replace the earlier DES.AES uses repeat cycles or "rounds." There are 10, 12, or 14 rounds for keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively. The input text is represented as a 4 x 4 array of bytes. The key is represented as a 4 x n array of bytes, where n depends on the key size.

                            Each round of the algorithm consists of four steps: <br>
                                
                                <ital>subBytes:</ital> For each byte in the array, its value is used as an index into a fixed 256-element lookup table, and is replaced by the byte value stored at that location in the table. <br>

                                <ital>shiftRows:</ital> If R.i denotes the i'th row in state, this step circularly shifts R.0 in the state left 0 bytes, R.1 left 1 byte, R.2 left 2 bytes, and so on until all rows are shifted. These shifts do not affect the individual byte values themselves. <br>

                                <ital>mixColumns:</ital> For each column of the state, the column is replaced by its value multiplied by a fixed 4 x 4 matrix of integers (in a particular Galois Field). The inverse operation multiplies by a different matrix. <br>

                                <ital>addRoundkey:</ital>This final step XOR's the state with a 128-bit round key derived from the original key K by a recursive process. For encryption, the final round is slightly different from the others and there is an additional addRoundKey. For decryption, the initial round is slightly different and there is an additional addRoundKey.

                            <strong>Description:</strong> This program implements a password cracking algorithm for a traditional Unix system, where passwords are stored in encrypted form in a world-readable file /etc/passwd.This program was written not in a malitious manner, but instead it was meant to enhance the understanding of why many systems enforce rules to ensure that user-generated passwords are not easily guessed words. This program involves both cleverness and brute force by encrypting a sequence of strings and comparing the results against the stored encrypted passwords of the system. The strings created as password guesses are made from a combination of a list of common dictionary words, and key-words known about the user (ex. name, hometown, alma mater, etc.), and some mangling functions that each slightly transform the string in a different way, such as reversing the string or appending a number to the end. If any of the trial encyrptions match stored encrypted passwords, the program will know the corresponding cleartext password for that user.

                            <strong>Description:</strong> Given a list of the relative frequencies of successive characters in an n-character alphabet, this program first computes the entropy of the language. With these computed probabilities, the program then uses the Huffman algorithm to devise a binary encoding on this alphabet, and creates a large file of randomly generated characters at their expected probabilities. The file is encoded using the already created binary encoding, then decodes the file and measures the efficiency of the encoding by computing the actual average bits per symbol as it translates. This process is repeated with a 2-character alphabet and the compression encoding efficiency is measured.

                            <strong>Description:</strong> These are just a few of the programs I have written outside of academic reasons, most of them are games. Some of them are very primative because I wrote them when I first began learning how to code, but I have since become more experienced and have produced more efficient and complex programs. Here are some of the programs I have written so far: <br>
                                <ital>Blackjack:</ital> This game is a fully functional blackjack game, playing against the dealer. It allows you to bet your chips, double down, split hands, and so on. It is command-line interface. 
                                <br>
                                <ital>Minesweeper:</ital> This game was actually written as part of my intro to programming class, but I figured it fit better with the game section. It is a full minesweeper game, and includes a GUI. 
                                <br>
                                <ital>Tic-Tac-Toe:</ital> I wrote two different versions of this game, one a while back when I was still learning how to program, and another more recently. The first version was written in Java, and is not very good code. I came back later and re-wrote the game in C in a much more efficient way. It is command-line interface. 
                                <br>
                                <ital>Trivia:</ital> This game is a bit more personal, and is essentially a Jeopardy trivia game full of facts about myself, and was written for fun to test my family and friends on how well they knew me.
                                <br>
                                <ital>Number Guess:</ital> This is a simple number guessing game, where you think of a number between 1-1000 and the computer guesses it in just a few tries. It implements a binary search algorithm to find the number.
                                <br>
                                <ital>Rock Paper Scissors:</ital> This is a simple implementation of classic rock paper scissors, where you pick your move and the computer randomly picks theirs. The results are compared and the win count is kept.
                                <br>
